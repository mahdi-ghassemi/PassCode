# PassCode Idea

This is a simple idea to complicate the password entry mechanism. For example suppose your password is a simple phrase 123456, but when you enter it you have to pause between 3 and 4 for about 2 seconds. If you enter this password in a non-specified form, you will not be able to log in.
Therefore, if someone knows your password but does not know that they have to enter it in the form mentioned, they can not log in.
This app was written to test this idea. This mechanism can be more complicated.
